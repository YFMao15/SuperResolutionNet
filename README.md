# SuperResolutionNet
Super resolution neural network implemented via Tensorflow

The folder "Original" contains some high resolution microbiological images, and the folder "Label" has corresponding low resolution images obtained by bicubic interpolation. 

The MainSRN is the main function to the model and other utillites. Change the hyperparameters and other parameters in this file instead of changing them in the SRNModel or UtilFunction.
